At the exit of \"the fabric\", I need to head roughly 40 meters south until I reach the intersection between Richide Road and Fortuna Street. Fortuna Street, known for its chic atmosphere above Citrus Tunnel and Citrus Hall, stretches to the west. I'll follow Fortuna Street until I come across Citrus Station, where the stolen UNU Mastodon Coupe has probably been spotted. This could be a significant lead in retracing the stolen vehicle's path.",
