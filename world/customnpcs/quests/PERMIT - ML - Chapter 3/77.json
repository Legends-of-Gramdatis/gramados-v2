The hut is located in the middle of Pinoros Forest, a dense pine forest on a hill in the south of Gramados Island. I should take the road that leads to the southernmost point of the island and look for a small picnic stop called Pinoros Picnic Stop. From there, I'll need to follow the hiking path to the wooden hunting hut.",
