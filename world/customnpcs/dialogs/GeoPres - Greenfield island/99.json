    "DialogText": "Welcome to Greenfield Island, where the soil is fertile, and the opportunities are as abundant as the crops that sway in the breeze. Here's a glimpse of what our bountiful island has to offer:

Greenfield Island is a patchwork of many small farms, each offering a piece of our agricultural paradise. The farms here are diverse in size and affordability, ranging from the most affordable at under 200k grons to the most extensive, which can exceed a million. You'll find that the average farm costs between 250k to 300k grons, providing a range of options for aspiring farmers.

Every farm comes with a spacious garden where you can cultivate your very own crop culture. But that's not all; surrounding each farm, you'll discover numerous plots and fields available for purchase by the owner of the nearest farm. These additional fields are priced reasonably, with the cost typically ranging from 40k to 60k grons, depending on their size. With a ratio of about 16 fields for every 1 farm, you have plenty of room to expand your agricultural endeavors.
