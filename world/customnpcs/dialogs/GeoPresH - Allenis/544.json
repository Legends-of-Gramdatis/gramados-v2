This humble hilltop sanctuary has long served as a place of silence, clarity, and vows.
Islanders tell of a storm long ago, when a white gull entered the chapel and rested through the night. At dawn, the skies cleared - and the people called it a sign.

During the Soil Wars, its bell rang every week in protest. The sermons spoken here did not call for war, but for patience. And yet it was here that the first call to close the mines was heard, and echoed.

To this day, pilgrims walk the Sentier des Plumes to light a candle, leave a feather, or whisper a promise to the wind.
