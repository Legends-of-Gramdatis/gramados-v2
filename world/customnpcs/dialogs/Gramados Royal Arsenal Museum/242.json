Originally, this site was part of the arsenal factory that played a crucial role in our nation's history. The factory still operates, though it's not open to the public. The museum was set up in the former executive residences to offer a glimpse into our military past and marksmanship legacy. It stands as a tribute to the craftsmanship and innovation that has shaped our armed forces.",
