    "DialogText": "Gramados Island is not only known for its economy and transportation but also boasts several impressive landmarks worth visiting:

**The Twingo Juice Factory:**
- A massive industrial complex with its own worker's city, the Twingo Juice Factory is as awe-inspiring as it is unsettling. This 1920s megafactory features gigantic warehouses, towering chimneys, and even an industrial skyscraper rising over ten floors tall. At its heart, a large, mysterious chemical-laden basin holds a liquid integral to the production of the famous Twingo Juice.

**Gramados International Airport:**
- Our island is home to the Gramados International Airport, a large modern airport with distinctive architecture. A unique feature is a wall entirely composed of a half-cylinder glass structure, allowing passengers to enjoy a fantastic view of the airport tarmac as they wait for their flights.
