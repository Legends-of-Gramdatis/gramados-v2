    "DialogText": "**Citrus Alley:**
- Located on the north coast of Gramados Island, within Gramados City, Citrus Alley has a rich history. Originally an enormous 18th-century underground warehouse, this ten-meter-tall structure with grand arches served as a storage facility for harvested citrus. It featured a direct road to Gramados Port from the same era.
- In the 1920s, a portion of the warehouse crumbled, leading to a tragic accident and its temporary closure. However, a decade later, it was reconstructed and transformed into a vast hall. Numerous fancy buildings from the 1930s era sprang up around it, turning it into a stylish spot in town, adorned with elegant hotels and restaurants. This transformation remains intact even today.

While not officially designated as landmarks, the overall Gramados City Center is a captivating attraction. It features a blend of architectural styles, from Victorian to 19th-century buildings reflecting the influence of the industrial revolution. The city center's unique and varied facade makes it a notable part of the city.

Feel free to explore these landmarks, and if you have any questions or need directions, don't hesitate to ask.",
