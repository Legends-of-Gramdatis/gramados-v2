    "DialogText": "Welcome to Gramados Island, the largest and most developed island in the Gramados archipelago. Here's what you need to know about our beautiful island:

**Island Geography:**
- Gramados Island boasts a landscape that's predominantly flat, with some gentle hills.
- Our island is home to dense forests, including two unique biomes: tall oak forests and pine forests. You might encounter these forest types on other islands in our archipelago as well.

**Economic Specializations:**
- We're known for our wood production and industrial activities, which play a significant role in our island's economy.
- While we once excelled in citrus farming, urbanization has led to the transformation of many citrus farms into the generic tall oak and pine forests. A Citrus Hall stands as a reminder of our citrus-producing history.
- Our island's primary agricultural activity today is citrus farming, though not in heavy quantities.",
