    "DialogText": "**Bridges:**
- Gramados Island is connected to other islands in our archipelago via two bridges. 
  - One bridge extends northeast to Greenfield Island, providing convenient access to our neighboring island.
  - Another bridge leads west to Monsalac Island, offering a direct link to this unique island.
- In our plans for the future, a third bridge is proposed, extending south to Austin Island. While this bridge is yet to be constructed, it's part of our vision for enhancing island connectivity.

**Maritime Access:**
- Our island also features a commercial port located north of Gramados Island. This port serves both cargo and passenger transportation needs and is connected to Gramados City via a crucial coastal road.

Whether you're traveling by road, air, or sea, we strive to make your transportation experience as seamless as possible on Gramados Island.",
