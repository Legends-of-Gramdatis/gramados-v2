Now that you've completed the hunt, you'll need to take the White Stag's carcass to a taxidermist to have it preserved properly. The taxidermist is located on Feldpard Island at the Truck Stop. It's on the south side of the island, right after the bridge leading to Feldpard Island.

Once you've done that, be sure to return to Marcus Eldridge at the Gramados Town Hall to report your progress and find out what comes next.

Good luck with the taxidermist, and I look forward to hearing how it all turns out.",
