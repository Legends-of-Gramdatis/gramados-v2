In the early 1600s, before towers rose or roads were paved, this district was wild and fertile land tucked between sea breeze and forest shade. The first settlers recognized the richness of its soil and began planting citrus - oranges, lemons, tangerines, and pomelos - creating groves that would one day line every field and courtyard of what would come to be known as Citrus Alley.

By the mid-1800s, Citrus Alley had become the economic heart of Gramados Island. The district thrived as traders from neighboring islands and the mainland docked in Gramados Port to buy its golden fruit. The crowning achievement of this era was the construction of Citrus Hall in 1850 - a vast, subterranean storage and preservation facility built beneath a gentle hill to house thousands of crates of harvested citrus. The air here was cool, the trade bustling, and the future bright.",
