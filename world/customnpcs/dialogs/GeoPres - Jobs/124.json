   - Once you've established your connection with this NPC, you'll unlock access to related wholesalers.
   - These wholesalers will provide you with the necessary resources, support, and expertise to cultivate your Citrus Farm successfully.

Embracing the Citrus Farmer role is a rewarding endeavor, and we're committed to helping you make it a reality. Our island has a rich history of citrus farming, and we're excited to see this tradition thrive once again.
