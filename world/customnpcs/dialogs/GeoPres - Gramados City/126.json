    "DialogText": "**Drabus Strip:**
- The east side of the city, once home to a dismal district called Drabus, underwent transformation in the late 90s. Over half of it was demolished to make way for the construction of the Gramados International Airport.
- Despite much of the district being in a state of disrepair, its architecture remains charming. Typical buildings feature a brick ground floor and a wooden first floor with a small overhang, creating a unique architectural style.

**City Center:**
- The heart of Gramados City is marked by numerous buildings, including several small skyscrapers and government structures.
- These structures were predominantly built in the late 1890s and early 1920s, resulting in a dense urban core with a variety of Victorian apartment blocks.

**Billionaire's Mount and North Neighborhood:**
- The north of the city is graced with Billionaire's Mount, featuring magnificent mansions and chateaus that rank as the most expensive residences on Gramados Island.
- North of this hill, you'll find a fancy neighborhood with colorful 1930s houses. The area also includes the famous Citrus Alley, boasting 1930s fancy hotels and seaside restaurants.",
