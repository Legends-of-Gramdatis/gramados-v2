(After a brief moment on the phone)

Officer Reynolds is expecting you. You'll find his office at the second floor, to get there, go to the first floor, in the north wing. Take the hallway to your right, and before you reach the end, you'll find a door. Go through there, then take the stairs to the next floor. Officer Reynolds' office should be there behind you.",
