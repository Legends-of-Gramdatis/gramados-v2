    "DialogText": "Ever since, the chapel became a local curiosity. Mechanics began working under the archways, and eventually, the eastern wall was removed to install two rolling iron doors. The interior still bears the fresco of a seagull in flight above a stylized spark plug-a symbol now known as *El Embrague Divino* (\"The Divine Clutch\").

Today, Capilla del Arranque operates as both a shrine and a garage. Visitors still leave fish on the old altar, hoping to be blessed with mechanical fortune. Some say that on quiet nights, the wind through the open engine hoods hums like a distant hymn.

This plaque was placed in honor of the miracle of ignition, when stillness turned to motion and doubt to faith.
Here, the faithful once offered fish, and the Holy Seagull answered with wheels turning once more.
