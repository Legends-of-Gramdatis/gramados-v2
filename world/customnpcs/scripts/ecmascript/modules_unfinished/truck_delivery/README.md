# Truck Driver Module

This module is an unfinished project aimed at creating a prestige job for the Gramados modded Minecraft RP server (1.12.2). The goal was to implement a dynamic truck delivery system, but development was halted due to limitations with the MTS (Minecraft Transport Simulator) mod, which does not allow editing vehicle NBT when spawned in the world.

## Current State

The module currently includes several scripts and JSON files that provide the foundation for the truck driver system. Key features implemented so far:

- **Quest System**: Scripts for generating and managing truck delivery quests.
- **Destination Management**: A system for defining and managing delivery destinations.
- **Cargo System**: Logic for selecting and managing cargo for deliveries.
- **Smartphone Integration**: A prototype integration with the Smartphone OS module for managing trucker quests.

While the scripts provide a basic framework, the module lacks full functionality due to technical limitations.

## Planned Features

1. **Dynamic Delivery System**:
   - Generate random delivery quests with varying cargo, destinations, and rewards.
   - Scale difficulty and rewards based on player progression.

2. **Vehicle Integration**:
   - Seamless integration with MTS vehicles for realistic truck driving mechanics.
   - Support for custom vehicle configurations and upgrades.

3. **Smartphone App**:
   - A dedicated app within the Smartphone OS module for managing trucker quests.
   - Features for tracking active quests, viewing rewards, and managing progress.

4. **Player Progression**:
   - Track player performance and reputation as a truck driver.
   - Unlock new delivery routes and rewards based on reputation.

## Challenges and Considerations

- Overcoming technical limitations with the MTS mod to enable vehicle customization.
- Balancing quest difficulty and rewards to ensure engaging gameplay.
- Ensuring compatibility with other server systems and mechanics.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for multiplayer collaboration on delivery quests.
- Implement a GUI for managing delivery routes and cargo.
