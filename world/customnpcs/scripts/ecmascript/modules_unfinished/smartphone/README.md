# Smartphone OS Module

This module is an unfinished project aimed at creating a portable GUI system for the Gramados modded Minecraft RP server (1.12.2). The goal is to provide players with a smartphone-like interface to manage various aspects of the server, such as jobs, stock market, stats, and factions.

## Current State

The module currently includes a script (`smartphone_os_app.js`) that provides the foundation for the smartphone system. Key features implemented so far:

- **App Framework**: A framework for creating and managing apps within the smartphone.
- **Trucker App**: A prototype app for managing truck driver quests.
- **GUI System**: A customizable GUI for interacting with the smartphone.
- **Player Data Management**: Tracks player-specific data, including installed apps and app-specific data.

While the script provides a basic framework, it lacks integration with other server systems and additional apps.

## Planned Features

1. **Comprehensive App Ecosystem**:
   - Apps for managing jobs, stock market, stats, factions, and more.
   - Modular design to allow easy addition of new apps.

2. **Server-Wide Integration**:
   - Seamless integration with existing server systems, such as the job manager and stock exchange.

3. **Enhanced GUI**:
   - Improved visuals and usability for the smartphone interface.
   - Support for app-specific GUIs.

4. **Player Customization**:
   - Allow players to customize their smartphone with themes and layouts.

5. **Data Persistence**:
   - Ensure all smartphone data is saved and persists across server restarts.

## Challenges and Considerations

- Balancing complexity and usability to ensure the system is accessible to all players.
- Ensuring compatibility with existing server mechanics and future updates.
- Designing a robust framework for app development.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for notifications and alerts.
- Implement a marketplace for downloading new apps.
- Introduce multiplayer collaboration features for shared apps.
