 * It gifts the player a bike from the loot table and logs the event.
 * It also checks if the player has already been gifted to avoid duplication.
 * If the player has already been gifted, it does nothing.
 * If the player has not been gifted, it pulls a bike from the loot table,
 * gives it to the player, and adds the player to the gifted list.
 * Finally, it saves the updated gifted list to a JSON file.
