# Building in Gramados Server

Welcome to the Gramados Server, a modern RP (Role-Playing) environment where players can start their journey with simple jobs, earn cash, and eventually own industries or farms. Established in 2015 and continuously developed since 2017, Gramados offers a stable and long-term platform for building, exploring, and enjoying the game.

## Becoming a Gramados Builder

If you're interested in building and are a trustworthy player, you can become a Gramados Builder. Here's what you can do:

- Construct various buildings in existing towns, villages, and countryside areas.
- Build new roads to expand the map.
- Populate roads with gas stations, hotels, farms, and other structures.

### Gramados Builder Lord

For those with grander ambitions, you can become a Gramados Builder Lord, creating your own town with your own rules, as long as they are conventional*.

## Building Guidelines

### Roads

- **No Dead Ends:** Ensure roads have a purpose and destination. Avoid ending roads abruptly in the middle of nowhere. Consider looping roads back onto themselves or connecting them to a structure.
- **Clean Roads:** Avoid floating roads. Except for bridges, solidify the base with retaining walls. For curved roads, use retaining walls on the sides.
- **Road Convention:** Use the FVTM mod for road construction unless building grids or driveways. Common road types include:
  - **Standard Road:** 5-block wide lanes with white lines between lanes and on each side. Add a gravel layer on each side if there are no sidewalks or walls.
  - **Thin Roads:** (Specific details to be confirmed)

### Map Respect

- **Respect the Topology:** Avoid large-scale flattening of terrain. Build on flat ground if needed. If terraforming is necessary, ensure it is well-crafted and blends naturally.
- **Retaining Walls:** For flat land on steep surfaces, build retaining walls that are visually appealing and fitting to the environment.

### Other Guidelines

- **Approval for Big Projects:** Obtain approval for large structures or projects.
- **Navigable and Presentable:** Ensure unfinished areas remain navigable and visually appealing. If you leave a building incomplete, cover facades with black blocks and add roofs to avoid open interiors.
- **Dynmap Updates:** Notify @theoddlyseagull about new government, cultural, service centers, shops, garages, and restaurants to update the dynmap, even if interiors are not yet completed.

## Gramados Builder Lords

For those creating their own towns or villages, follow these guidelines:

### Mandatory Requirements

- **Free Area:** Confirm the area is available for building to avoid conflicts with planned developments.
- **Road Link:** Ensure your town is connected to the existing road network. If necessary, build a connecting road.
- **Government Approval:** Plan or build a town hall for your new settlement.
- **Local Services:** For settlements larger than a hamlet, build a multi-service center with a fire department, police station, and healthcare facility. This can be a compact structure accommodating at least one vehicle per service.

### Recommendations

- **Minimum Services:** For settlements larger than a hamlet, include the following:
  - Fuel station
  - Restaurant
  - Furniture shop
  - Garage
  - Post office

- **Lore:** Adding lore to your settlement enhances the experience for players, giving your town or village a rich history and depth.

By following these guidelines, you'll contribute to the vibrant and dynamic world of Gramados, making it a better place for everyone. Happy building!
