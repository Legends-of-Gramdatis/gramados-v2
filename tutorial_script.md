Tutorial level for Gramados
===========================

- Welcome and orientation:
A small presentation of the basics of the lore, here the player will learn about Gramados monarchy, and Gramados City Town Hall: where he spawned.

- Commands: first step
Gramados adds its own command system, based on "!" instead of "/". You can run !help to see what is available. Also see !menu to see the main features of Gramados based on commands.

- main Economy and currency
Gramados currency is in Grons and cents. As a player you have access to a pouch and many commands to move money. You can see it using !mymoney
On death, you do not use your inventory, but 50% of your pouch drops on the floor. But if any money items are in your inventory, they will also drop.
If you have money item in mainhand, run !deposit to move it to your pouch, if you have multiple money items across your inventory, run !depositall to move it all in your pouch.
To take money from your pouch, use !withdraw <amount>. To withdraw 10g, run !withdraw 10g, to withdraw 14.5g, run !withdraw 14g50c. If you wish to withdraw 30 10g bills in 1 command, run !withdraw 10g 30.

- Banks
Banks are a great feature of Gramados. You can create a bank account, that can be frozen for some time, allowing it to gain interest. You can collect it for profit overtime. Running !help bank will show you the commands. To cfreate an account run !bank make "name". Run !mybanks to see a list of all your accounbts, their code, value and more. Running this command will also show an intuitive menu to interact with.

- Loans
Gramados also allows players to take loans, that will have to be paid back with interest. To take a loan, run !loan take <amount>. You can only pick one. To pay it back, run !loan pay <amount>. To see your loan, run !myloan.

- Other currencies
In your pouch, you'll find 4 currency: Grons, Arcade Money, shop money, and Vote Money. Grons is the main currency, vote money is gained through voting for the server on websites, arcade money is gained in events and lotteries, and in the long run, shop money will be through micro-transactions. Keep in mind that shop money is only for aesthetics, like new emotes in chat, car skins, or chat color

- Journey to discover the map
This will be a very long quest made of multiple chapters and step. The idea is to have a chpater per island, and in each chapter, will be steps to discover the island, landmarks, settlements...

- Finding your first home: Starter Hotels
Starter hotels are buildings present all over Gramados server, where new player can rent cheap rooms for the start of their journey. The first IRL week will be free, then the hotel rooms will cost a small fee depending on the hotel. Some large starter hotels will also hase some sort of mini commercial hub in or near them, who's purpose are too allow players to rent a shop space to start their business. This is not yet implemented, but WIP.

- Getting your first job
On Gramados' islands are multiple opportunities for "starter jobs". A starter job is usually an easy job that requires little to no investment, but usually doesn't make a lot of money. The idea is to give new players a way to make money, and to learn the basics of the economy. Some examples of starter jobs are: lumber, concrete factory worker or terracotta factory worker. Lumbers are available on most islands, while teh factories are only available in Gramados and in teh future, other industrial areas.

- getting a better job
Many jobs will need an investment from the player. For example, being a farmer: to be a farmer the player must buy a valid farm and farmhouse. Once he owns his farm, he will be granted the job. In some islands, you can expand your farm by buying more terrain.

- Getting your first house
After a while, you'll want to move out of the starter hotel and get your own house. Houses are available all over the map, in cities and countryside. Even though some houses are already sat up for this feature, many aren't, and you'll have to call a staff member for him to set it up. In a house ready to be bought or rented, you can run the command !region buy or !region rent while standing inside the available house. The price will be displayed in chat, and you can confirm the purchase or rent by interracting with chat. Over time you can also sell your house.

- getting a car
Cars are a great way to move around the map. You can buy a car by calling a staff member. There are a huge variety of different cars to choose from. You can also buy car skins to customize your car. Cars can be used to move around the map, and to transport goods.
Buying a car will also give you teh car's papers. You'll need them in case you have an accident and need a replacement. Along staff, there are also garages owned by players that could help you fix your car.
