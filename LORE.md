### The History of Farmiston and Rivetshore: From Lords to Revolutionaries

**Farmiston** and **Rivetshore** have a long, turbulent history that has shaped the politics and economy of these islands within the Gramados archipelago. Once independent regions ruled by different aristocratic families, their histories are marked by conquest, rebellion, revolution, and eventual independence. Here's the tale of how these two islands became intertwined under the banner of the **Realm of Verdonis**, and how their story unfolded through the centuries.

### **The 16th Century: The Realm of Verdonis and the Conquest of Rivetshore**

In the 16th century, **Farmiston**, known for its vast, fertile fields, was ruled by the powerful and feared **Lord Mathis Vernis**. Mathis was a ruthless leader who governed his land with an iron fist, using any means necessary to maintain his power. While the people of Farmiston suffered under heavy taxes and oppressive rule, Mathis set his sights on expanding his territory. His goal was to take control of the neighboring **Rivetshore Island**, which, at the time, was also fertile land, ripe for agricultural development.

After a series of brutal, bloody battles, Lord Vernis successfully conquered Rivetshore, uniting the two islands under the banner of the **Realm of Verdonis**. This new realm, encompassing Farmiston and Rivetshore, represented a significant power shift in the region. To secure his hold on the islands, Vernis installed his loyal military commander, **Ulric Durnell**, as governor of Rivetshore. Although the islands were now united, the people of Rivetshore resented their new rulers and the heavy taxation imposed upon them.

Vernis’ wife, **Lady Elira Vernis**, played a key role in stabilizing the internal politics of the realm. Known for her sharp diplomatic skills, she worked behind the scenes to ensure the union between the two islands remained strong. Despite their efforts, tension between the aristocracy and the people of both islands simmered, setting the stage for future conflicts.

### **The 17th Century: The Grainfire Rebellion**

By the 17th century, the people of **Rivetshore** and **Farmiston** had had enough. The overtaxed and oppressed farmers and workers of both islands banded together, led by a charismatic farmer from Farmiston named **Galen "The Red" Varris**. His leadership sparked the **Grainfire Rebellion**, a mass uprising against the aristocracy and the legacy of Lord Vernis. The rebellion quickly grew in strength, with peasants and workers from across the islands uniting under the banner of freedom from tyranny.

However, the rebellion’s initial success turned sour when, after overthrowing the established lords, a new leader emerged from the chaos: **Tobias Draegor**, a former revolutionary who seized power for himself. Draegor proclaimed himself the new Lord of Verdonis and established a regime that, while less oppressive than Vernis', still failed to live up to the promises of the rebellion. The people had traded one autocrat for another.

**Tobias Draegor’s family** ruled for generations, maintaining power over the islands through a mixture of populism and military might. His daughter, **Katria Draegor**, is remembered for strengthening the Draegor dynasty and managing the delicate balance between appeasing the people and maintaining control.

### **The 18th Century: Fort Harbenshire and the Rise of Defenses**

Fearing invasion from neighboring islands still loyal to the monarchy, **Lord Marek Draegor**, a descendant of Tobias, commissioned the construction of **Fort Harbenshire** in the 18th century. This massive fortress, located on both **Farmiston** and **Rivetshore**, symbolized the Draegor family’s desire to solidify their power and protect the realm from external threats.

Fort Harbenshire was designed by the renowned military architect **General Faelan Warrick**, whose strategic brilliance turned the fort into one of the most formidable defensive structures in the region. The fort’s construction marked a period of heightened tension between the **Realm of Verdonis** and the other islands of the Gramados archipelago, as aristocrats loyal to the king sought to bring Farmiston and Rivetshore back under royal control.

### **The 19th Century: Industrial Revolution and the Transformation of Rivetshore**

As the industrial revolution swept across the world in the 19th century, **Rivetshore** underwent a dramatic transformation. Once fertile and green, the island’s landscape was irrevocably changed with the discovery of vast oil reserves. **Milosz Varek**, a wealthy industrialist from Rivetshore, spearheaded the island’s development into a hub of heavy industry. Oil rigs, refineries, and factories replaced the farmlands, and the once-agrarian economy shifted to oil production and manufacturing.

While Milosz profited immensely from this transformation, the environmental impact was devastating. His wife, **Annika Varek**, was a vocal advocate for workers' rights and sought to improve conditions for the laborers toiling in Rivetshore’s refineries and factories. Thanks to her efforts, the first labor reforms on the island were passed, though the damage to the environment remained irreversible.

### **The 20th Century: The Communist Regime and the Fall of Verdonis**

The 20th century brought yet another radical shift to Farmiston and Rivetshore. Amidst the global wave of political revolutions, the islands fell under the control of a communist regime led by **Marshal Kolya Teranin**. Teranin, a fierce revolutionary, overthrew the Draegor dynasty and established a state that nationalized the islands' industries and farms. While the regime aimed to create equality, it instead imposed strict government control over all aspects of life, leading to widespread discontent.

**General Pavel Korovin**, Teranin's second-in-command, was known for his brutal methods in maintaining order. His harsh rule kept the regime in power but bred resentment among the people.

The communist era ended in **1991** when **Irina Volkov**, a pragmatic political leader, brokered a peaceful transition of power. After the fall of communism, **Farmiston** and **Rivetshore** declared independence, becoming separate but cooperative islands once again. The two islands abandoned their shared communist past and began rebuilding their economies, with Rivetshore maintaining its focus on industry, while Farmiston returned to its agricultural roots.

### **Legacy of the Realm of Verdonis**

The story of **Farmiston** and **Rivetshore** is one of conquest, rebellion, revolution, and reinvention. From the tyrannical rule of **Lord Mathis Vernis** to the short-lived people's rebellion led by **Galen "The Red" Varris**, and finally, to the rise and fall of the communist regime, the history of these islands is a reflection of the larger struggles for power and control within the **Gramados** archipelago.

Today, the remnants of this history can be seen in landmarks like **Fort Harbenshire**, a symbol of a bygone era of aristocratic rule, and in the oil refineries and industrial centers that still dominate Rivetshore’s landscape, a testament to the island’s transformation during the industrial revolution.













Now, Monsalac Island.
Monsalac island is a mountainous island, with it's economy focused on milk, kumis, and cheese.
Monsalac island has played an important role of "buffer" between Rivetshore/Farmiston, and Gramados Island.
This island is quite cold and windy, but turned into a nice destination for nobles and bourgeois, aspeacially around Chaseals. Still today, the center of the village has a few beautiful 17 and 18th century mansions, even though they seen dark days.
