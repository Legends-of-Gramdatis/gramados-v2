# 🏝️ Solterra Island – Full Lore & Landmark Guide

## 📌 Overview

Solterra is a sun-drenched island in the southern Gramados Archipelago, known for its **flat terrain**, **wide beaches**, and **old Iberian charm**. Despite its calm appearance, Solterra has long served as a crossroads of faith, tradition, and quiet miracles.

The island’s identity is deeply tied to the myth of the **Holy Seagull**, a spiritual figure revered across Solterra and beyond. Pilgrims still walk the dusty paths between ancient chapels, following what is known as **El Sendero Blanco** — the White Trail.

Its architecture draws from **rural Spain**, with whitewashed chapels, terracotta roofs, and a palette of warm stone. Farming, fishing, and increasingly, tourism, form the basis of the local economy.
