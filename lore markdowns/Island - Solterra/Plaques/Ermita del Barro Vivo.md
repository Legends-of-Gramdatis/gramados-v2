### ðŸ“œ **Plaque: Ermita del Barro Vivo**

*Hermitage of the Living Clay*

Built in the center of CÃ¡ntaro, this humble chapel honors the breath of the kiln and the sacred stillness of earth before the flame.
It is said that here, during the longest drought in living memory, a single jug placed at the altar filled with water overnight - soft clay turned vessel, and vessel turned miracle.

Potters still leave their first works beneath the altar, hoping they too will fire true.

"All form begins with yielding."
