*The Three Kilns of the Vow*

Once the heart of CÃ¡ntaroâ€™s ceramic craft, these kilns shaped generations of pots, tiles, and sacred vessels. Their final fires were lit long ago, but the plaza remains a space of ritual and respect.

The kiln at the center is called El Silente, the one to the left El Paciente, and to the right El Ardiente. During feast days, villagers leave a single unfired vessel within the arches in hopes of future blessings.

"Even cold clay can remember the flame."
