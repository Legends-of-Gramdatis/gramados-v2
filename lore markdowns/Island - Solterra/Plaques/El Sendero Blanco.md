*The White Path*

You now walk a portion of El Sendero Blanco, the ancient pilgrimage trail that winds through Solterraâ€™s chapels, fountains, and sacred rises.
Each step follows the breeze of the Holy Seagull, whose quiet miracles continue to shape this land.

Pause where you feel called. Rest where water flows. Listen for wind, and leave no offering in haste.

"The clay remembers the hand, and the wind remembers the vow."
