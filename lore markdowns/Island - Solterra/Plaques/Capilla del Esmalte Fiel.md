**Capilla del Esmalte Fiel**
*Chapel of the Faithful Glaze*

Built in the shadow of the old plaza, this house of devotion honors the unseen breath that keeps clay from cracking and fire from devouring. Its ceramic inlays were glazed in a single batch, now called "the Batch of Certainty."

Each season, new artisans leave a pot beside the altar before their first solo firing, asking the winds to carry their fear away.

"If your hands waver, may the flame still hold."
