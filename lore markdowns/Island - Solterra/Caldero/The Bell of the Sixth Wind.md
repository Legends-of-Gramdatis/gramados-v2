**La Campana del Sexto Viento**
*The Bell of the Sixth Wind*

High above Caldero, in the northern tower of the Palacio de la Guardia, hangs a bell unlike any other.

Its tone is said to echo not through air, but through memory â€” a sound not heard, but felt.
Legends speak of the Six Winds, ancient and unseen forces that once whispered through the land, guiding the seers and stirring the souls of pilgrims. This bell, it is believed, tolls only for those who walk with open hearts and silent purpose.

It has not rung in living memory. Yet still, each year, footsteps climb the spiral, not in expectation, but in reverence.

May the silence remind us that some truths are not spoken â€” only understood.
