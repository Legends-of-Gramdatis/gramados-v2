### ðŸª§ **Plaque â€“ Capilla del Arranque**

**Capilla del Arranque**
*Once a place of silent prayer, now a place of roaring engines.*

This modest structure was originally built in the early days of Caldero as a humble roadside chapel, offering a shaded alcove for travelers and fishermen to leave offerings-most often fish-in hope of safe journeys and calm seas. Perched just beyond the old town path, it was rarely visited except by the most devoted pilgrims of the Holy Seagull.

That changed the day a rusted-down Trin Footpather broke down beside it. With no explanation, the car was mysteriously restored overnight. The next morning, a trail of sardines was found arranged in a spiral near the altar, and a small feather lay on the dashboard. The legend spread fast.

Ever since, the chapel became a local curiosity. Mechanics began working under the archways, and eventually, the eastern wall was removed to install two rolling iron doors. The interior still bears the fresco of a seagull in flight above a stylized spark plug-a symbol now known as *El Embrague Divino* ("The Divine Clutch").

Today, Capilla del Arranque operates as both a shrine and a garage. Visitors still leave fish on the old altar, hoping to be blessed with mechanical fortune. Some say that on quiet nights, the wind through the open engine hoods hums like a distant hymn.

This plaque was placed in honor of the miracle of ignition, when stillness turned to motion and doubt to faith.
Here, the faithful once offered fish, and the Holy Seagull answered with wheels turning once more.
