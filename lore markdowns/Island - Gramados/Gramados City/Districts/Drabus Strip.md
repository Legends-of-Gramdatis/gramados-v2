# 🧱 Drabus Strip – District of Gramados City

## 📌 Overview

**Drabus Strip** is a transitional and partially decaying district on the **east side of Gramados City**, once known as the **Drabus District**. It was historically a modest but vibrant residential and industrial area made up of small townhouses and artisan workshops. In the late 1990s, over half of the district was demolished to make way for the **Gramados International Airport**, and the remaining section was renamed "Drabus Strip."

Today, the Strip stands at a crossroads — slowly shrinking due to rezoning, yet still clinging to a unique architectural charm and quiet, nostalgic atmosphere. Though its infrastructure is crumbling, the area maintains a deep sense of local identity and fading beauty.
