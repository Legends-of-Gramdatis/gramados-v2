**QUESTLINE OVERVIEW: Under Pressure**
*A legacy hidden in dust, a boiler reborn.*

A seemingly mundane boiler malfunction at the Moulin-Fournelet bakery in Trilnat (Feldpard) sends the player on a journey across multiple islands, into the industrial past of Trin Motors. From forgotten warehouses to hostile fuel stations, the search for a rare prototype Trin part slowly unravels a broader picture ‚Äî one that hints at the black-market demand for vintage tech and ties to organized crime.

### üñäÔ∏è DIALOGUES

**NPC: Julien Fournelet**

**Page ‚Äì Post-Inspection Briefing**

* **Text**:
  "Soot? Steam leaks? Dammit. I was hoping it was just a fuse.

Well, you‚Äôve got good eyes. That thing‚Äôs been clunking along since my grandfather‚Äôs time. Believe it or not ‚Äî Seagull Trin himself came through here. Refit the boiler using leftover kiln piping... and a strange regulator no one's made since."

"If that part‚Äôs busted, we‚Äôve got a problem. But if anyone still has records‚Ä¶ it‚Äôll be the Trin dealership by the old Atelier. They handle all the historic requests."

* **Player Input**:

  1. "I'll head there now."

####

**NPC: Dealership Clerk**

**Page ‚Äì Greeting**

* **Text**:
  "Welcome to Trin of Trilnat! What can I help you with today?"

* **Player Input**:

  1. "I‚Äôm here about an old boiler. Bakery in town ‚Äî Moulin-Fournelet."

**Page ‚Äì Boiler Enquiry**

* **Text**:
  "That bakery boiler? You‚Äôre serious? I‚Äôve heard the story, yeah ‚Äî something about Seagull Trin patching it up during a supply shortage. Honestly didn‚Äôt think it was still running."

  "We don‚Äôt keep those kinds of parts in the front office. But if you‚Äôre looking for help, the folks in the repair bay know the older designs better than I do. Head through the big opening in the north wall ‚Äî it leads straight into the garage."

* **Player Input**:

  1. "On my way."

####

**NPC: Trin Maintenance Rep**

**Page ‚Äì Greeting**

* **Text**:
  "You‚Äôre the one Julien sent? Alright, come on in. I was told you‚Äôve got an old boiler acting up. What‚Äôs the story?"

* **Player Input**:

  1. "It‚Äôs a mess. Soot everywhere, steam leaks. Weird old fittings too."

**Page ‚Äì Description Received**

* **Text**:
  "Hmm. You‚Äôre describing something that sounds a lot like a custom rig. Let me guess ‚Äî ceramic housing? Over-threaded pipe ends? You‚Äôre probably dealing with one of the Seagull-era retrofits."

  "Julien called ahead, said you handled that rat infestation too. That got you some points in our book. Not everyone respects grain stock and gear equally."

* **Player Input**:

  1. "Any chance you‚Äôve got a replacement part for it?"

**Page ‚Äì Warehouse Access**

* **Text**:
  "Wish I could say we had one in stock ‚Äî but no. That part‚Äôs a relic. We haven‚Äôt used those since before most of our team was even born."

  "You‚Äôve got one last hope: the old Trin assembly depot. It‚Äôs from the 1940s, built back when the family still assembled vehicles right here in Trilnat. After the production line shut down in the 90s, it became a sort of catch-all ‚Äî spare parts, damaged units, prototype leftovers. Nobody‚Äôs sorted it in years."

  "You‚Äôll find it just southwest of here, between the pond and the Trin family house. Stone building, matching the rest of the town. Looks quiet on the outside, but inside it‚Äôs a scrapyard of history. If that regulator ‚Äî or even a schematic ‚Äî survived, it‚Äôll be somewhere in there."

  "Keep your eyes open, and‚Ä¶ maybe wear a helmet. Some of those old crates aren‚Äôt what I‚Äôd call stable."

- **Player Input**:

  1. "Got it. Heading there now."
