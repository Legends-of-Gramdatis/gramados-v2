# ðŸ“˜ **Pieces of What Remains**

Set in the crumbling heart of Drabus Strip, *Pieces of What Remains* is a quiet, emotional side quest about memory, resilience, and the parts of life we choose to preserve. The player meets Marcel, an aging mechanic clinging to the rusted shell of his past â€” a broken-down station wagon from another era. What begins as a simple errand to find a missing tire unfolds into a deeper journey through forgotten garages, burnt homes, and the invisible weight of time.  

This questline doesn't offer fame or fortune. Instead, it asks players to slow down and see value in restoration â€” not of machines, but of people. Through fragments of memory and small acts of care, players help Marcel reassemble something intangible: dignity, connection, and a sense that the past still matters in a city trying to forget it.

Tire blew out three winters ago. Haven't had the means to fix it. Boombox gave out a bit later. Used to sit in the backseat, play tapes, watch the light shift over Drabus roofs...

Now it's just wind and sirens.
```
**Player Input:**
- I could help you fix it.

```
...You would? Damn. I won't forget that.
Start with the tire. I heard there's a van parked by the old general store down Drabus Street. Whitewall, just like mine. Might be your best shot.
```
**Player Input:**
- I'll check it out.

Well, would you look at thatâ€¦ that's the right tire, alright. Whitewall and all.
It's been years since I saw one that clean around here.
Remy let it go?
```
**Player Input:**
- Yeah. Said you'd know what to do with it. And that some things still roll forward if you push 'em.

Hehâ€¦ sounds like Remy, alright.\nBack in the day, we'd fix up junkers like this with nothing but stubbornness and tape.\nNow? Folks just let things rot.\n\nYou know, there was always music in the garage. Not from some fancy radio â€” just a cassette, always looping.\nKept the silence out. Made the rust feel like rhythm instead of decay.
```
**Player Input:**
- Sounds like you're missing more than just the car. Maybe I could find something that brings that feeling back?

Heh... I'm not picky. Doesn't have to be the cassette â€” just something that sounds like back then.\nWarm chords, soft vocals, a touch of longing. Something that remembers, you know?\n\n...You know that burnt-out house past the corner of Drabus and Old Hay? The one barely standing?\nKid used to live there â€” maybe seventeen, tops. Always dragging that boombox around.

He'd sit out on the steps in the evenings, playing tapes. Real quiet stuff. Dreamy, maybe a bit sad. But it fit.\nEven when the wind carried the music crooked, it still sounded... whole.\n\nOne night the house caught fire. Never saw the kid again. Folks say he made it out, moved south. I dunno.\nBut part of me thinks the music's still in there somewhere. Just stuck in the ashes.
```
**Player Input:**
- I'll see if I can find it.

You know, it's funny... It's not about fixing things. It's about remembering the parts of life that keep us going, even when we can't put everything back together. This tape... it's more than just a song, it's a piece of who we were.\n\nHere. I've got a few things that might help you out. Don't go thinking this means I'm done with you yet.
```
**Player Input:**
- Thanks, Marcel. I think I understand. You've got your way of holding on to the past, even if it's not easy.

Take this with you. A repair kit. You never know when you'll need it. And this... It's a FRM Upgrade. Helps with your vehicle's engine. Not much for a showy boost, but it'll keep things running smoother when you need it.\n\nLet's keep â€˜em all running, huh? Take care of yourself.
```
**Player Input:**
- I will. And Marcel... thanks for trusting me with this.

Well well, fresh shoes on Drabus clay. What brings ya to this corner of the city's spine?
```
**Player Input:**
- Marcel said you might have a whitewall I could use.

Marcel still kickin' around that rust bucket, huh? Heh... Knew that man'd rather breathe fumes than give up on her.

Yeah, I've got the wheel. Salvaged it off a junker long ago. Still holds air, I think. But I don't just hand over memories like that.
```
**Player Input:**
- What do you want for it?

### Page - Remy Request 1
**Text:**  
```
Used to work that garage right behind us, before the bank took it and the roof caved in.

In my old locker â€” green one, near the back wall â€” I had a wrench. Custom, marked with my name. Still dream about the weight of it in my hand.

Bring that wrench back to me, and the wheel's yours. Fair?
```
**Player Input:**
- Fair enough. I'll find it.

```
...Well I'll be damned. That's her. Still got the little dent from when she fell under the lift, see?
Didn't think you'd actually find it. Most folks don't bother with a place that's already been left behind.
This wrench's fixed more than engines. Held my whole damn shop together once. Feels good to hold it again, even just for a bit.

You're helpin' more than you know, kid. Not just Marcel and his old clunkerâ€¦ This street needs folks who still care.

Take the wheel. One of the last I had in decent shape. Marcel's right to trust you. Go put it to use.
```
**Player Input:**
- Thanks my man.
