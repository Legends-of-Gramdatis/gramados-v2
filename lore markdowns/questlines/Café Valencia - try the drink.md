**Text**:
Oh my gosh, you’re here too? This place is *amazing*. The plaza tiles even have little orange slices – did you notice?? And the air smells like fresh lemon zest! I swear there’s a guy somewhere misting the streets.
She leans in, lowering her voice.
Okay but the real magic? **Café Valencia**, just tucked under that wall over there. They do this wild frozen citrus drink – like sour, sweet, fizzy, and spicy *all at once*. It’s called the **Valencian Fire Zest**. It literally made my eyes water and I still went back for more.
She grins wide.
Have you tried it yet?

**Player Input**:

* [No, not yet.](#go-taste-it)

### 🟠 [Go Taste It!](#go-taste-it)

**Text**:
You have to! It's just 30m from here – see that little building built into the plaza wall? Between the hotel and the hall? That’s **Café Valencia**. Just ask for their signature drink.
She raises her half-finished glass.
I’ll wait here. And no cheating – I’ll know if you didn’t actually drink it!

### 🟠 [Zest Buddies!](#zest-buddies)

**Text**:
You tried the Fire Zest, right? I knew it!! That first sip hits like candy - then BAM! Citrus chaos!
She holds up her drink and taps it twice.
I’ve had four. Not even sorry. I think I’ve unlocked a new dimension of flavor perception. Everything tastes like lemons now.
She laughs, then pauses dramatically.
...But in a good way.
She leans in.
Next time, ask them for the 'Extra Fire' version. It’s... illegal in some islands.

**Player Input**:

* I'm scared to ask what's in it.
* One was enough for me, thanks.
* Worth it.
