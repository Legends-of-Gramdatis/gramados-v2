**QUESTLINE OVERVIEW: Under Pressure**
*A legacy hidden in dust, a boiler reborn.*

A seemingly mundane boiler malfunction at the Moulin-Fournelet bakery in Trilnat (Feldpard) sends the player on a journey across multiple islands, into the industrial past of Trin Motors. From forgotten warehouses to hostile fuel stations, the search for a rare prototype Trin part slowly unravels a broader picture — one that hints at the black-market demand for vintage tech and ties to organized crime.
