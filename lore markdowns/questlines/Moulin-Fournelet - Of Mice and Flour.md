**Page – After Granivole Cleanup**

* **Text**:
  "You’re back in one piece! And no flour cloud trailing you — that’s promising. Those granivoles won’t know what hit them."

"Tell you what, you’ve earned a proper break. Anything you're curious about?"

* **Player Options**:

  1. "This place has so much character... mind telling me its history?" → \[Page 3 – Story of the Mill (Part 1)]
  2. (Locked until lore is read) "I’ve heard about that old boiler. Is it still giving trouble?" → \[Page – Boiler Trouble Start]

→ **Completes Quest: Report Back to Julien**

**Page – Boiler Trouble Start**

* **Text**:
  "You're not wrong. She's working, sure, but the noises she makes lately... not the good kind. Whistles, sputters — and I swear I saw a puff of black soot indoors."

"I’ve been meaning to look into it, but there’s only so much I can do while baking bread. Maybe you could give it a look — if you’re up for a bit more than just pest control."

→ **(Will eventually lead to new questline)**

### Variant A – First Time Ever

**Page 1 – Welcome to Moulin-Fournelet**

* **Text**:
  "Oh—bonjour! You must be new in town. I'm Julien Fournelet, baker and mill-keeper of this... *remarkable* building. It’s seen better days, but she still bakes a good loaf!"

"Listen, I wouldn’t usually ask a newcomer, but... we’ve got a bit of a rodent—or rather, *Granivole*—problem in the storage."

"Nasty little things. They’ve chewed straight through sacks of grain. I spotted five of them just this morning. If you can help, I’ll toss you some of the good stuff from today’s batch."

* **Player Options**:

  1. "I'll do it. But do you have anything I could use against them?" → \[Page 2 – Pitchfork Offer]
  2. "This place looks ancient. What’s its story?" → \[Page 3 – Story of the Mill (Part 1)]
  3. "Maybe later, just curious about the mill." → \[Page 3 – Story of the Mill (Part 1)]

**Page 2 – Pitchfork Offer**

* **Text**:
  "There should be an old pitchfork left in the mill room, behind the counter. Go grab it, and then go wild on those flour-thieves. Just don’t poke any sacks by mistake."

→ **Starts Quest: Tools of the Trade**

**Page 3 – Story of the Mill (Part 1)**

* **Text**:
  "Ah, this place… the Moulin-Fournelet. It started life as a fortified farm centuries ago. The square tower you see now? That used to be the lookout post. The farmers built high — back then, raids and beasts were a real concern."

**Player Input**: "Fortified farm? Interesting." → \[Page 4 – Story of the Mill (Part 2)]

**Page 4 – Story of the Mill (Part 2)**

* **Text**:
  "Over the years, it was turned into a proper working farm. They built up the west side, raised a two-floor barn — inspired by those Forez-region styles. Upstairs was grain storage, and downstairs, the cows. They even dug a dirt ramp for carts to unload at the upper gate."

**Player Input**: "That sounds like a well-oiled system." → \[Page 5 – Story of the Mill (Part 3)]

**Page 5 – Story of the Mill (Part 3)**

* **Text**:
  "For a long time, a little stream powered everything. The water wheel you saw outside used to turn the grindstone down below. Wheat came in upstairs, dropped down the chute, and came out as flour in the backroom."

"But by the time industry hit Trilnat — textile works, redirection canals, the whole shebang — the stream dried up. And that’s when things got… complicated."

**Player Input**: "So what happened next?" → \[Page 6 – Story of the Mill (Part 4)]

**Page 6 – Story of the Mill (Part 4)**

* **Text**:
  "We couldn’t afford to shut the place down. So we looked for alternatives. A steam boiler was added upstairs, third floor under the roof. It powers the mill below through belts and shafts now."

"Coal deliveries come in from the side, and the whole west wall's full of lifts and old crane hooks. It’s a patchwork system, but it works."

**Player Input**: "And that’s when Trin stepped in?" → \[Page 7 – Story of the Mill (Part 5)]

**Page 7 – Story of the Mill (Part 5)**

* **Text**:
  "Exactly. Seagull Trin — the Seagull himself — came by while testing early truck engines. Said he admired the stubbornness of the mill. Helped rig the boiler’s inner valves and replaced half the steam piping with parts from an old ceramic kiln."

"He said this place didn’t deserve to die. That’s why I keep it running. With luck, and a little less granivole trouble, we’ll keep baking a while longer."

**Player Input**: "Thanks for the story." → Ends dialogue

### Variant B – First Time After Boiler Fixed

**Page 1 – Back to Business**

* **Text**:
  "Just when I thought we had a moment of peace... guess who’s back? Granivoles. Probably smelled the new flour shipment."

"You handled them well last time. Think you could give it another go? I’ll keep a loaf warm for you."

* **Player Options**:

  1. "Sure, I’ll handle it." → \[Page 2 – Accept Repeat Job]
  2. "Actually, I still want to hear about this mill’s history." → \[Page 3 – Story of the Mill (Part 1)]
  3. "Maybe later, just curious about the mill." → \[Page 3 – Story of the Mill (Part 1)]

**Page 2 – Accept Repeat Job**

* **Text**:
  "Same drill. Five little critters. Try not to knock over any flour barrels this time."

→ **Starts Quest: Granivole Trouble**

---

### Variant C – Default Repeatable

**Page 1 – Back Again, Friend**

* **Text**:
  "Ah! My reliable pest expert. You’ve no idea how much easier the mornings are since you started helping out."

"There’s scratching upstairs again. Think it’s time for another sweep?"

* **Player Options**:

  1. "Always happy to help." → \[Page 2 – Accept Friendly Repeat]
  2. "Still curious about this old place. Got time to talk?" → \[Page 3 – Story of the Mill (Part 1)]
  3. "Maybe later, just visiting." → \[Page 3 – Story of the Mill (Part 1)]

**Page 2 – Accept Friendly Repeat**

* **Text**:
  "Appreciate it as always. You’re practically family around here."

→ **Starts Quest: Granivole Trouble**
