### 🗣️ DIALOGUES BY NPC

### **NPC: Julien Fournelet**

**Page – Post-Inspection Briefing**

* **Text**:
  "Soot? Steam leaks? Dammit. I was hoping it was just a fuse.

Well, you’ve got good eyes. That thing’s been clunking along since my grandfather’s time. Believe it or not — Seagull Trin himself came through here. Refit the boiler using leftover kiln piping... and a strange regulator no one's made since."

"If that part’s busted, we’ve got a problem. But if anyone still has records… it’ll be the Trin dealership by the old Atelier. They handle all the historic requests."

* **Player Input**:

  1. "I'll head there now."

---

### **NPC: Dealership Clerk**

**Page – Greeting**

* **Text**:
  "Welcome to Trin of Trilnat! What can I help you with today?"

* **Player Input**:

  1. "I’m here about an old boiler. Bakery in town — Moulin-Fournelet."

**Page – Boiler Enquiry**

* **Text**:
  "That bakery boiler? You’re serious? I’ve heard the story, yeah — something about Seagull Trin patching it up during a supply shortage. Honestly didn’t think it was still running."

"We don’t keep those kinds of parts in the front office. But if you’re looking for help, the folks in the repair bay know the older designs better than I do. Head through the big opening in the north wall — it leads straight into the garage."

* **Player Input**:

  1. "On my way."

---

### **NPC: Trin Maintenance Rep**

**Page – Greeting**

* **Text**:
  "You’re the one Julien sent? Alright, come on in. I was told you’ve got an old boiler acting up. What’s the story?"

* **Player Input**:

  1. "It’s a mess. Soot everywhere, steam leaks. Weird old fittings too."

**Page – Description Received**

* **Text**:
  "Hmm. You’re describing something that sounds a lot like a custom rig. Let me guess — ceramic housing? Over-threaded pipe ends? You’re probably dealing with one of the Seagull-era retrofits."

"Julien called ahead, said you handled that rat infestation too. That got you some points in our book. Not everyone respects grain stock and gear equally."

* **Player Input**:

  1. "Any chance you’ve got a replacement part for it?"

**Page – Warehouse Access**

* **Text**:
  "Wish I could say we had one in stock — but no. That part’s a relic. We haven’t used those since before most of our team was even born."

"You’ve got one last hope: the old Trin assembly depot. It’s from the 1940s, built back when the family still assembled vehicles right here in Trilnat. After the production line shut down in the 90s, it became a sort of catch-all — spare parts, damaged units, prototype leftovers. Nobody’s sorted it in years."

"You’ll find it just southwest of here, between the pond and the Trin family house. Stone building, matching the rest of the town. Looks quiet on the outside, but inside it’s a scrapyard of history. If that regulator — or even a schematic — survived, it’ll be somewhere in there."

"Keep your eyes open, and… maybe wear a helmet. Some of those old crates aren’t what I’d call stable."

* **Player Input**:

  1. "Got it. Heading there now."

**Page – Blueprint Returned**

* **Text**:
  "Well now… look what you’ve dug up. This is one of the early schematics for the thermal regulator. Handmade, looks like. Paper’s older than my dad’s wrench set."
  "They didn’t just toss these around. Whoever drew this was either working on something unique or desperate."

* **Player Input**:

  1. "So… what does it mean for the boiler?"

**Page – Technical Insight**

* **Text**:
  "It confirms it, alright. The part you’re missing is a pressure-tolerant thermal regulator, ceramic casing, wide thread. But not just any unit — this one had custom heat channels, probably hand-milled. Prototype-grade."
  "And those weren’t mass-produced. Hell, this design was used in exactly one application we know of — experimental steam-assist systems in low-output builds. Trin tried them in the late 40s, early 50s… scrapped the project not long after."
  "We don’t build or stock these anymore. Haven’t for decades."

* **Player Input**:

  1. "So… we’re stuck?"

**Page – The Lead**

* **Text**:
  "Maybe. But there’s one guy who might know more than all of us put together."
  "Name’s Almard Feros. Used to work Trin’s original line here in Trilnat before they moved the major ops to Rivetshore. He helped assemble the first batch of Trumons, Footpathers, the works. Eventually transferred to the Rivetshore plant when it opened in '66."
  "He’d know if that part ever made it into production — or if it was just one of Seagull’s mad experiments."

* **Player Input**:

  1. "Where can I find him?"

**Page – Where to Look**

* **Text**:
  "Buglaton, east side. Brick rowhouse in a sea of painted ones. Looks like a sore thumb, but that’s Almard — no time for flashy coats or new trims."
  "He’s long retired, but folks say his garage is still cleaner than most clinics. If anyone remembers this part or even has a lead on a working one… it’s him."
  "Just... don’t try to impress him with buzzwords. He’s old-school. Bring the blueprint, and keep it respectful."

* **Player Input**:

  1. "Thanks. I’ll head there now."

### **NPC: Almard Feros**

**Page – Grumpy Welcome**

* **Text**:
  "*—BANG BANG—* …You knock like the police. What now?"
  "*...If it’s about that damn chimney inspection again, I told them: I burn *clean* coal!*"

*The door creaks open slowly.*
"*Oh, you're not one of those clipboard vultures. You're too confused looking.*"

* **Player Input**:

  1. "I’m actually looking for someone who worked on Trin engines. Specifically... thermal regulators?"

**Page – Confused Old Man**

* **Text**:
  "Thermal what-now? Regulator? You from the parts commission?"
  *He squints hard.*
  "You don’t *look* like you know a carburetor from a croissant. What’s this about, really?"

* **Player Input**:

  1. "It's for a bakery, actually. In Trilnat. The boiler's broken. It's an old one — Seagull Trin himself apparently helped install it."

**Page – Wait, What?**

* **Text**:
  "...A bakery boiler? …In Trilnat? Seagull Trin?"
  *He snorts.*
  "You been drinking engine coolant or something?"

"Seagull Trin didn’t do plumbing, kid. He helped design engines, suspension systems, even a few military contracts. But a bakery…?"
*He pauses. Thinks.*
"...Wait. Hold on."

* **Player Input**:

  1. "Look, I found this blueprint in the Trin warehouse. Matches what broke."

**Page – Realization**

* **Text**:
  *He takes the blueprint with trembling fingers.*
  "...Well I’ll be greased and grounded. This... this is a Type-B Thermo-Reg. Look here — ceramic shell, triple-thread coupling, hexagonal core channel. That’s the real deal."

*He points to a small faded stamp.*
"That’s my seal. Stamped this myself back in… '46? Maybe '47?"

"There were only about 30 of these ever built. Prototypes, too tricky for mass production. Only Seagull ever asked for spares."

* **Player Input**:

  1. "So this *is* the part the boiler needs?"

**Page – Ramble & Warning**

* **Text**:
  "Not just any part, @p — this is a rare bird. A headache and a masterpiece. Built to handle inconsistent pressure flow with minimal lag. Overkill for a bakery? Sure. But Seagull had a soft spot for ridiculous fixes."

*He sets the blueprint down gently.*
"But you’re outta luck. If your unit blew, it’s firewood now. You won’t find another one in the mail."

"Unless…"
*He leans in a bit.*
"There’s an old Trin fuel station and depot just north of the steel mill. Northeast of the factory — you probably passed it coming in from the rowhouses."

"Back in the day, they stocked all kinds of parts for roadside repairs. Later, it doubled as a dump for surplus and rejected gear. Including experimental stuff like this."

* **Player Input**:

  1. "So it might still be there?"

**Page – The Catch**

* **Text**:
  "Could be, yeah. But don’t expect a welcome mat. Last I heard, some scavvers moved in. Got in through the service alley. Not sure what they’re after — vintage pumps maybe, or the black-market scrap trade."

"They’ve been holed up there a while. Folks keep their distance."

*He taps the blueprint one last time.*
"If there’s a working Type-B regulator still ticking on this planet… it’s probably rotting under a tarp in that depot."

*He gives a dry chuckle.*
"Course, it’ll only cost you a few bruises and maybe a tetanus booster."

* **Player Input**:

  1. "Sounds like a party. I’ll check it out."
