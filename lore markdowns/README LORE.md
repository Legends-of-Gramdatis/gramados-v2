### The History of Farmiston and Rivetshore: From Lords to Revolutionaries

**Farmiston** and **Rivetshore** have a long, turbulent history that has shaped the politics and economy of these islands within the Gramados archipelago. Once independent regions ruled by different aristocratic families, their histories are marked by conquest, rebellion, revolution, and eventual independence. Here's the tale of how these two islands became intertwined under the banner of the **Realm of Verdonis**, and how their story unfolded through the centuries.

---

### **The 16th Century: The Realm of Verdonis and the Conquest of Rivetshore**

In the 16th century, **Farmiston**, known for its vast, fertile fields, was ruled by the powerful and feared **Lord Mathis Vernis**. Mathis was a ruthless leader who governed his land with an iron fist, using any means necessary to maintain his power. While the people of Farmiston suffered under heavy taxes and oppressive rule, Mathis set his sights on expanding his territory. His goal was to take control of the neighboring **Rivetshore Island**, which, at the time, was also fertile land, ripe for agricultural development.

After a series of brutal, bloody battles, Lord Vernis successfully conquered Rivetshore, uniting the two islands under the banner of the **Realm of Verdonis**. This new realm, encompassing Farmiston and Rivetshore, represented a significant power shift in the region. To secure his hold on the islands, Vernis installed his loyal military commander, **Ulric Durnell**, as governor of Rivetshore. Although the islands were now united, the people of Rivetshore resented their new rulers and the heavy taxation imposed upon them.

Vernis’ wife, **Lady Elira Vernis**, played a key role in stabilizing the internal politics of the realm. Known for her sharp diplomatic skills, she worked behind the scenes to ensure the union between the two islands remained strong. Despite their efforts, tension between the aristocracy and the people of both islands simmered, setting the stage for future conflicts.

### **The 17th Century: The Grainfire Rebellion**

By the 17th century, the people of **Rivetshore** and **Farmiston** had had enough. The overtaxed and oppressed farmers and workers of both islands banded together, led by a charismatic farmer from Farmiston named **Galen "The Red" Varris**. His leadership sparked the **Grainfire Rebellion**, a mass uprising against the aristocracy and the legacy of Lord Vernis. The rebellion quickly grew in strength, with peasants and workers from across the islands uniting under the banner of freedom from tyranny.

However, the rebellion’s initial success turned sour when, after overthrowing the established lords, a new leader emerged from the chaos: **Tobias Draegor**, a former revolutionary who seized power for himself. Draegor proclaimed himself the new Lord of Verdonis and established a regime that, while less oppressive than Vernis', still failed to live up to the promises of the rebellion. The people had traded one autocrat for another.

**Tobias Draegor’s family** ruled for generations, maintaining power over the islands through a mixture of populism and military might. His daughter, **Katria Draegor**, is remembered for strengthening the Draegor dynasty and managing the delicate balance between appeasing the people and maintaining control.

---

### **The 18th Century: Fort Harbenshire and the Rise of Defenses**

Fearing invasion from neighboring islands still loyal to the monarchy, **Lord Marek Draegor**, a descendant of Tobias, commissioned the construction of **Fort Harbenshire** in the 18th century. This massive fortress, located on both **Farmiston** and **Rivetshore**, symbolized the Draegor family’s desire to solidify their power and protect the realm from external threats.

Fort Harbenshire was designed by the renowned military architect **General Faelan Warrick**, whose strategic brilliance turned the fort into one of the most formidable defensive structures in the region. The fort’s construction marked a period of heightened tension between the **Realm of Verdonis** and the other islands of the Gramados archipelago, as aristocrats loyal to the king sought to bring Farmiston and Rivetshore back under royal control.

### **The 19th Century: Industrial Revolution and the Transformation of Rivetshore**

As the industrial revolution swept across the world in the 19th century, **Rivetshore** underwent a dramatic transformation. Once fertile and green, the island’s landscape was irrevocably changed with the discovery of vast oil reserves. **Milosz Varek**, a wealthy industrialist from Rivetshore, spearheaded the island’s development into a hub of heavy industry. Oil rigs, refineries, and factories replaced the farmlands, and the once-agrarian economy shifted to oil production and manufacturing.

While Milosz profited immensely from this transformation, the environmental impact was devastating. His wife, **Annika Varek**, was a vocal advocate for workers' rights and sought to improve conditions for the laborers toiling in Rivetshore’s refineries and factories. Thanks to her efforts, the first labor reforms on the island were passed, though the damage to the environment remained irreversible.

---

### **The 20th Century: The Communist Regime and the Fall of Verdonis**

The 20th century brought yet another radical shift to Farmiston and Rivetshore. Amidst the global wave of political revolutions, the islands fell under the control of a communist regime led by **Marshal Kolya Teranin**. Teranin, a fierce revolutionary, overthrew the Draegor dynasty and established a state that nationalized the islands' industries and farms. While the regime aimed to create equality, it instead imposed strict government control over all aspects of life, leading to widespread discontent.

**General Pavel Korovin**, Teranin's second-in-command, was known for his brutal methods in maintaining order. His harsh rule kept the regime in power but bred resentment among the people.

The communist era ended in **1991** when **Irina Volkov**, a pragmatic political leader, brokered a peaceful transition of power. After the fall of communism, **Farmiston** and **Rivetshore** declared independence, becoming separate but cooperative islands once again. The two islands abandoned their shared communist past and began rebuilding their economies, with Rivetshore maintaining its focus on industry, while Farmiston returned to its agricultural roots.

---

### **Legacy of the Realm of Verdonis**

The story of **Farmiston** and **Rivetshore** is one of conquest, rebellion, revolution, and reinvention. From the tyrannical rule of **Lord Mathis Vernis** to the short-lived people's rebellion led by **Galen "The Red" Varris**, and finally, to the rise and fall of the communist regime, the history of these islands is a reflection of the larger struggles for power and control within the **Gramados** archipelago.

Today, the remnants of this history can be seen in landmarks like **Fort Harbenshire**, a symbol of a bygone era of aristocratic rule, and in the oil refineries and industrial centers that still dominate Rivetshore’s landscape, a testament to the island’s transformation during the industrial revolution.













### The History of Monsalac Island: The Noble Buffer and the Rise of Rebellion

**Monsalac Island** stands as a mountainous, cold, and windswept land within the Gramados archipelago. Known for its rich production of milk, kumis, and cheese, Monsalac has long served as a buffer zone between the tumultuous regions of **Farmiston** and **Rivetshore** and the more politically stable **Gramados Island**. Over time, it attracted members of the nobility, drawn by its wealth of natural resources and the burgeoning community of **Chaseals**, famed for its high-quality products and growing bourgeoisie. To this day, the village of Chaseals retains a few elegant 17th- and 18th-century houses and small mansions from the era, though some have borne witness to dark histories.

---

### **The 17th Century: The Grainfire Rebellion and the Night of the Manor Bloodshed**

During the Grainfire Rebellion in the 17th century, a wave of anti-aristocratic sentiment swept through **Monsalac Island**. The rebellion, initially centered in Farmiston and Rivetshore, found resonance among the oppressed laborers and farmers of Monsalac as well. On **September 16, 1683**, the revolutionary spirit reached a fever pitch in Chaseals. That night, a group of ten individuals—led by a respected but disillusioned bourgeois named **Pascal Hervieu**—broke into two mansions, secondary residences of nobles who frequently visited Monsalac to oversee their business ventures and local industries. The nobles, notorious for their exploitation of the workers, were targeted by the rebels and assassinated in their beds.

The very next day, the island’s lord, **Baron Henri Laressier**, suffered a similar fate. His estate, known as **Castle Avencliff**, was stormed and plundered by villagers from nearby towns who had suffered under his rule. Castle Avencliff’s sprawling farm dependencies, once the cornerstone of the lord’s wealth, were repurposed by the locals, eventually becoming a wholesale center where players now export their goods. Though the baron himself was slain, the **Laressier family**—who were away on Gramados Island during the revolt—remained intact.

When the news reached the surviving Laressiers, they mobilized a small army, supported by the king, to reclaim their lands. Within weeks, they returned to Monsalac and quelled the rebellion, ruthlessly suppressing any opposition. Once victorious, they restored their estate, reinforcing their authority over the island for years to come.

---

### **The 19th Century: The Rise of Industry and the Second Laressier Tragedy**

The 19th century saw Monsalac Island’s transformation as the industrial revolution took hold. To capitalize on this progress, the **Marquis Etienne Laressier** constructed a large industrial facility along a stream dividing Chaseals from a smaller landmass dominated by **Chaseals Peak**, a tall, imposing mountain. This new factory harnessed water from the stream, drawing workers and industry to the island like never before. Though profitable, the factory created significant tensions between the wealthy Laressiers and the local workforce.

By the mid-20th century, these tensions erupted into another bloody conflict. In a brutal workers' revolt, the laborers, angered by oppressive working conditions, attacked the Laressier family estate. The rebellion was ruthless; the Laressier grandparents, the mother, and two sons were killed, sparing only the father, **Marquis Antoine Laressier**, his son **Alain**, and his young daughter **Celeste**. Their castle was torched, and the family lost both the factory and its assets, leaving them no choice but to flee to Gramados Island.

The ruins of **Castle Avencliff** remain on Monsalac’s southern shore, a solemn testament to the island’s turbulent past and the downfall of the once-dominant Laressier family. The noble estate was never rebuilt, but the family did not vanish from Monsalac entirely.

---

### **Modern Era: The Return of the Laressiers**

In recent decades, the Laressier family, now led by **Marquis Alain Laressier**, has quietly returned to Monsalac. Though their fortunes have diminished, they have managed to purchase several farms and reclaim their influence over certain areas of the island. Today, they reside in a modest mansion on the island's eastern side, a humbler but resilient remnant of their former grandeur.

The story of **Monsalac Island** is etched into its landmarks—from the thriving marketplaces of Chaseals to the haunting ruins of Castle Avencliff. The island’s history mirrors that of Farmiston and Rivetshore in its blend of aristocratic power, rebellion, and resilience, yet its role as a political buffer has given Monsalac a distinct character and a legacy both proud and tragic.

### **Historical Timeline**

#### **The Rise of Feldpard Crystal (1627)**
In **1627**, **Lord Edrin Veledar** of the mineral-rich Alden Peaks discovered crystal glass, a breakthrough that transformed Feldpard’s economy. His chemist, **Master Harlan**, made this discovery by accident while experimenting with feldspar and silica. Crystal glass production became a lucrative enterprise, and House Veledar rose to prominence as the **Crystal Keepers**.

Despite this rise, the Veledars' alliance with the royal family slowly faded, leaving them with wealth but diminishing influence over time.

---

#### **The Tyranny of Lord Adamar Veledar, The Feared (1723-1724)**

By the early 18th century, **Lord Adamar Veledar**, known as **The Feared**, began a campaign of violence and conquest in an attempt to control all of Feldpard. Ignoring royal decrees, he imposed heavy taxes, seized trade routes, and tried to monopolize the island’s mineral resources.

In **1723**, the other noble houses formed an alliance led by **Lady Alayna Drasor** of Thalora Plains. They launched a joint attack on Adamar’s forces, culminating in the **Battle of the Betrayed**. Adamar was captured, and the following year, on **August 3, 1724**, he was executed at **Widow’s Cliff**. In a dramatic public event, Adamar was thrown from the cliff, bringing his tyrannical rule to an end. The cliffs became a symbol of justice, commemorated annually by all Feldpard.

---

#### **The Shattered Accord and Renewed Conflicts**

Following Adamar’s death, the allied houses divided his lands through an agreement known as the **Shattered Accord**. However, disputes quickly re-emerged over resource rights and territorial boundaries. By **1732**, skirmishes had resumed, and the island was once again divided, with each house seeking to expand its control over valuable lands.
