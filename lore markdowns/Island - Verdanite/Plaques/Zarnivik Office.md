### ðŸª§ Zarnivik Office

Ministry of Internal Development and Civil Allocation
Completed in 1894

Erected during the height of the Stratokarnic period, the Zarnivik Office serves as the principal seat of the Ministry of Internal Development and Civil Allocation â€” the administrative body responsible for regulating the growth, structure, and allocation of civil land and infrastructure across the nation of Gramados.

Within its layered halls, permits are reviewed, zoning boundaries debated, and entire settlement layouts archived. Every public square, canal, or residential block must trace its origin back to this buildingâ€™s records.

Its vast Karnate Citadel form reflects the Ministryâ€™s guiding belief: that space must be ordered before it is occupied, and that every city, village, or highway is not merely built â€” it is permitted into existence.

To stand before Zarnivik is to stand before the very geometry of statehood.
