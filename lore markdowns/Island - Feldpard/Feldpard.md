### **Historical Timeline**

#### **The Rise of Feldpard Crystal (1627)**
In **1627**, **Lord Edrin Veledar** of the mineral-rich Alden Peaks discovered crystal glass, a breakthrough that transformed Feldpard’s economy. His chemist, **Master Harlan**, made this discovery by accident while experimenting with feldspar and silica.

#### **The Tyranny of Lord Adamar Veledar, The Feared (1723-1724)**

By the early 18th century, **Lord Adamar Veledar**, known as **The Feared**, began a campaign of violence and conquest in an attempt to control all of Feldpard. Ignoring royal decrees, he imposed heavy taxes, seized trade routes, and tried to monopolize the island’s mineral resources.

In **1723**, the other noble houses formed an alliance led by **Lady Alayna Drasor** of Thalora Plains. They launched a joint attack on Adamar’s forces, culminating in the **Battle of the Betrayed**.

In a dramatic public event, Adamar was thrown from the cliff, bringing his tyrannical rule to an end. The cliffs became a symbol of justice, commemorated annually by all Feldpard.
