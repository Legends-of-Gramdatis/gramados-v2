# 🏔️ Monsalac Island – Full Lore & Landmark Guide

## 📌 Overview

Monsalac is a rugged, snow-covered island located northwest of Gramados Island. Known for its **dairy production**, **steep mountains**, and **rebellious history**, the island remains one of the most visually dramatic and politically scarred parts of the archipelago. Its narrow cliffside roads, pine forests, and remote hamlets form a land both challenging and beautiful.

Monsalac specializes in **cheese**, **milk**, and **kumis**, produced in small, independent farms scattered across highland valleys. Though peaceful today, its landscape still carries the memory of past uprisings and the fall of a noble dynasty.

The island divides into several distinct zones:

* **Northwest**: Home to Chaseals village, once a retreat for the nobility.
* **Center**: Treacherous highlands with sharp slopes and snowy ridgelines.
* **South**: Historical center of noble power — the Avencliff Plateau.
* **East**: Flatter coastal lands where Ashwick Manor now stands.
* **Offshore**: Chaseals Peak, a small separate island with symbolic presence.
