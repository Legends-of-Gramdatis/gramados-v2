## 🏰 Castle Avencliff – Finalized Canon Lore (Post-Revision)

Perched above the southern coast of Monsalac Island, **Castle Avencliff** is a grand estate with a history as dramatic as its architecture. Once the ancestral seat of the **Laressier noble family**, the castle has twice stood at the center of rebellion, class warfare, and political upheaval.

### 🔥 Rebellion and Ruin

The castle was first **stormed and looted** during the **Grainfire Rebellion** of 1683, when villagers overthrew Baron Henri Laressier and repurposed his estate’s outbuildings for communal use. Though the castle itself suffered damage, the Laressiers returned with a royal-backed army and reestablished their dominance, eventually repairing the estate.

But in the **mid-20th century**, the story turned violent once more. Amid rising industrial tension, **factory workers revolted**, killed most of the Laressier household, and **torched Castle Avencliff**. The interior was gutted, the structure blackened by fire, and the surviving family fled into exile. For a time, the castle stood as a hollow monument — a stone shell overlooking a fractured land.

### 🧱 Restoration and Modern Renewal

In the late 20th century, the castle was **purchased by a wealthy private individual** — a collector, aesthete, and historian of architecture. With considerable funds and cultural sensitivity, this new owner undertook a full restoration of Castle Avencliff. The **facades and silhouette** were meticulously reconstructed in keeping with the original 17th-century style, while the **interior was entirely redesigned**, bringing modern comfort and curated elegance behind the historic stone.

What once were soot-streaked halls and collapsed ceilings now host stately rooms, restored gardens, decorative ponds, and striking features like the **symmetrical colonnades and grand entry avenue**. The **arched walkways** flanking the approach to the castle, though visually reminiscent of aqueducts, serve no hydraulic function — they are purely ornamental, added as part of the restoration to amplify the castle’s visual axis.

Today, Castle Avencliff is **fully intact**, a place where old-world nobility and modern restoration meet. The Laressier coat of arms can still be seen faintly on certain lintels, but the estate is no longer a political stronghold — it is a **privately owned property**, often admired from afar for its commanding beauty and symbolic resilience.
