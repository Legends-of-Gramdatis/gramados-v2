**🗺️ Allenis Island – Landmark Summary List**

- 🏰 **Château Vinor**  
The grandest wine estate on Allenis, Château Vinor stands atop the northern hills, overlooking the terraced vineyards it helped shape. Home to the influential Vinor family, the estate is credited with introducing modern pruning methods and producing the iconic *Vin d'Écho*. It embodies the island’s wine heritage, nobility, and stubborn pride.

- 📡 **Tour de Cimefoudre**  
Built in the 1930s to broadcast news and commodity prices across the archipelago, this towering radio mast still hums with low static today. During storms, locals claim it emits strange signals or even music. Once a symbol of modernity, it now stands as a metallic relic wrapped in island legend.

- ⛪ **Sanctuaire des Plumes**  
This modest hilltop church played a spiritual and political role during the Soil Wars, when its bell tolled weekly in protest against mining. Legend tells of a white gull that sheltered here through a storm, taken as a sign of the island’s sacred resilience. Pilgrims still walk from Allen Point to its gates on feast days.

- 🪨 **Roche des Chants**  
A mossy stone hidden deep in Coalgrove Forest, the *Roche des Chants* was where farmers and vintners secretly met to sign the pact that began the Soil Wars. Locals believe it hums softly at dusk and holds the echoes of names long forgotten. It is a silent monument to peaceful resistance.

- 🐏 **Le Veilleur des Collines**  
These stone ruins on the island’s western heights once served as a shepherd’s outpost. The croft fell into disuse after flocks were moved eastward, but tales remain — including one of a shepherd whose offering to a passing gull turned a deadly storm away. Today, it is a place of solitude for wanderers who reach it via a quiet hiking path.

- 🌲 **Coalgrove Forest**  
This dense pine forest splits Allenis in two — wine country to the north, pastures to the south. Once scarred by mining operations, it has since regrown into a lush divide. Certain trees still bear old white slashes from miners’ tools, left untouched as a mark of memory.

- 🕳️ **Old Coal Mine**  
Sealed in 1947, the old coal mine represents the peak and fall of Allenis’ industrial age. Once hailed as the island’s future, its polluted runoff and collapsing tunnels nearly destroyed farming life. Now overgrown and quiet, the site draws hikers, history enthusiasts, and the occasional treasure hunter.

- 🏘️ **Prime Meat & Wine Market**  
Housed in the old Allen Point train station, this market transformed from an ore-shipping hub into the heart of the island’s luxury meat and wine trade. It hosts the annual *Fête du Sol Retrouvé*, celebrating the land’s recovery. The market is where tradition, protest, and prosperity now converge.
