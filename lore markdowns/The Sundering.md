# :clock: Timeline of the Legends of Gramdatis

The world of Gramdatis is divided into three major historical eras: **Gramdamus**, **Gramados**, and **Gramthanix**. These eras are defined by two cataclysmic events: the **Sundering of the Cradle** and the **Sunstorm**. These turning points reshaped both the land and the way time is counted.

## :dragon: The Gramdamus Era

**Before Year 0 GC – “Before the Great Sundering”**

* A time of high civilization, mythical power, and ancient empires.
* Technology and sorcery coexisted — siege engines, arcane constructs, and forgotten sciences were wielded by humans and magical creatures alike.
* The world consisted of vast interconnected continents ruled by powerful cultures.
* Ends with the **Sundering of the Cradle**, triggered by a final conflict between mankind and mythological beings such as dragons and divine beasts.
* This battle released catastrophic energy — magical, divine, and elemental — destabilizing the world’s very structure.

## :earth_africa: The Sundering of the Cradle

**Year 0 GC – Start of the Gramados Calendar**

* Unleashed seismic, magical, and atmospheric devastation.
* Continents broke apart; regions were drowned or hurled skyward.
* Survivors were scattered across a new world of islands and broken terrain.
* The **Six Winds** were born — residual elemental flows believed to originate from the breath of ancient myth-born powers.
* Civilization did not vanish entirely: language, basic knowledge, and fragments of old power endured — but infrastructure, magic, and empire were lost.
* **Magic, now blamed for the collapse of the world, was actively banned.**
  Any surviving knowledge of the arcane was **forbidden**, **buried**, and **deliberately forgotten** by the survivors, who feared repeating the catastrophe.

## :tools: The Gramados Era

**Year 1 GC onward** *(Current Year: 725 GC)*

### :scroll: Years 1–200: The Fragmented Rebuilding

* Tribes and small communities emerged quickly, retaining scraps of the old world.
* Survivors reused ruined stone and ancient roads to rebuild villages and sanctuaries.
* **Arcane knowledge was rooted out wherever found**, suppressed by cultural taboo and enforced through early political or religious leadership.
* Memory of magic faded into legend, but its artifacts remained scattered.

### :european_castle: Years 200–500: The Regional Rise

* Coastal trade routes reconnected islands.
* Kingdoms and alliances formed across regions, laying the foundation for future states.
* Some Gramdamus ruins were rebuilt into hybrid settlements — part relic, part revival.

### :gear: Years 500–725: Modern Consolidation

* Rise of electricity, internal combustion, civil governments, and organized science.
* Creation of lab companies like **TFJ**, **Aurec Dynamics**, and **Neonvale Research Labs**.
* Roads, cars, industries, and inter-island economies flourished.
* Religion and myth became background forces — persistent in shrines and ruins, but rarely understood.

## :radioactive: The Sunstorm & the Gramthanix Era

**\~Year 850 GC (Still in the future)**

* A solar catastrophe — known as the **Sunstorm** — scorches the surface, destroys atmospheric stability, and irradiates the land.
* In the final decades, society collapses into chaos as all resources go into building massive underground **bunkers**. Civil war nearly erupts between classes.
* The Sunstorm hits. All above-ground life perishes. Cities, forests, oceans — erased.
* **Survivors live sealed underground for six generations**. Scientific progress continues in isolation.
