# 🏝️ Allenis Island – Full Lore & Landmark Guide

## 📌 Overview

Allenis is a small, scenic island located north of Gramados Island. Known for its charming early-renaissance architecture and agricultural heritage, the island is a hub for **prime meat** and **vintage wine**. Despite its size, Allenis plays an outsized role in the Archipelago’s economy and culture. Its terrain is hilly, its forests dense, and its roads remain untarred — only well-maintained dirt and cobbled paths cross the land.

The island is divided into two halves:

* **South**: Pastoral, with small family farms raising prized livestock.
* **North**: Terraced grape fields and grand wine estates.

Its **western arm** is entirely uninhabited, covered in forested hills and accessible only by walking paths.

Though largely peaceful today, Allenis carries deep scars from an industrial past. Its people still remember a time when the mines nearly devoured the land — and how the farmers pushed back.
