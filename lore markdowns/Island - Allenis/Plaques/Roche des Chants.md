### ðŸ“œ **Plaque â€“ Roche des Chants**

"Here, the land chose to remember."

This moss-veiled stone stood witness to one of Allenisâ€™ quietest revolutions.
In the heart of the Soil Wars (1923-1947), farmers, vintners, and shepherds gathered here in secret. They etched names, poured wine, and made a vow: the land would not be sold to the mines.

Some say if you press your ear to the stone at dusk, youâ€™ll hear the echo of voices - chants not of anger, but of care.

The rock does not forget.
And neither should we.
