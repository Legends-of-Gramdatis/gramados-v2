### ðŸ“œ **Plaque - Le Veilleur des Collines**

"He watched the hills. And the hills watched back."

These ruins mark the last shepherdâ€™s post on the islandâ€™s forgotten western arm.
Long before roads were drawn, this high croft stood as a silent sentinel - shelter for those who lived among wind, wool, and silence.

Local lore tells of a storm that veered away from the island after a lone shepherd, fearing the worst, offered his last cheese to a white gull perched on the roof.
The flocks survived. And for generations, no one built here again.

Now, the trail is walked not by shepherds, but by those seeking stillness.
